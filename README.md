# css-code-refactoring

With this Project refactoring code, I took on some of dans advice and minimised the code a bit so that I wasn't so overwhelmed then I borke thins down into smaller sections and worked on them individually.

- Firstly I worked on editing the HTML to make it more readable, I noticed that alot of divs were used, where they could be better replaced by header, footer or nav tags.

- Streamlining the CSS so that I could consolidate similar elements together and use less 'classes'.

- I also looked into changing some of the code to increse web accessability

Through doing this project some obsticles I need to look into include

- Web reavtivity, whenever I changed the screen size to a mobile device the boxes and writing would format oddly

- I tried to use flex boxes to correct this however when I added disply flex and flex wrap to try and solve the problem the 'benefits box' would move to a undesired location.
